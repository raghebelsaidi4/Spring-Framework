The project consists of several logics:

1. **DB Logics** (DB communication is mandatory)
   - Load Driver
   - Get Connection
   - Create Statement
   - Execute Query (subject to change based on requirements)
   - Close Connection  
   *Note: These steps must be repeated in every program, leading to boilerplate code.*

2. **Business Logic**

3. **Web Logic** (Request & Response)
   - Develop Form Display Logic
   - Form Validation
   - Capture Form Data
   - Store Form Data in Java Object

4. **Presentation Logics** (User Interface)

**What is a Framework?**  
A framework is a semi-developed, ready-made software that provides common logics for various project developments. It offers reusable components (classes and interfaces) and reduces the developers' workload.

**Examples:**
1. Capturing form data and storing it in a DB table:  
   JDBC + Servlet: 20 lines of code  
   Spring: 5 lines of code  
2. Driver + DriverManager + Connection + Statement + ResultSet (JDBC + Servlet)  
   becomes  
   `JDBCTemplate.execute(query)` or `HibernateTemplate.save(obj)` (Spring)

**In the Java Community, there are two types of frameworks:**
1. ORM frameworks (e.g., Hibernate)
2. Web frameworks (e.g., Struts, Spring)

**What is a Library?**  
A library is a collection of pre-written code that provides specific functionalities or utilities, allowing developers to avoid writing common logic from scratch.

**Differences Between Frameworks and Libraries:**
1. **Control Flow:**  
   - **Framework:** Dictates the flow of control; developers insert custom code as needed while the framework manages the overall application flow.  
   - **Library:** Developers control the flow, calling specific functions from the library as required.

2. **Purpose:**  
   - **Framework:** Provides a foundation and reusable components for building entire applications, including tools, conventions, and structure for common tasks like form handling and DB interactions.  
   - **Library:** Focuses on solving specific problems, such as date-time operations, JSON handling, or mathematical functions, without imposing structure on the application.
