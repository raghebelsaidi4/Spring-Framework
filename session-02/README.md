Spring is not a single framework but a collection of modules. 

- Spring 1.x had 7 modules.
- Spring 2.x had 6 modules.
- Spring 3.x expanded to over 20 modules.

The Spring framework is versatile and loosely coupled, with Spring Core serving as the base module. It provides an IoC container and dependency injection, allowing for the development of loosely coupled classes.

1. **UI Layer**:
   - Represents the User Interface, where interactions between the user and the system occur.
   - Technologies: Can include JSP, HTML, JavaScript, or frameworks like Angular or React.

2. **Web Layer**:
   - Handles HTTP requests and responses.
   - Built using servlets or frameworks like Struts (as shown in the diagram).
   - Struts framework facilitates the MVC (Model-View-Controller) design pattern and has been widely used over the past 6 to 7 years.

3. **Business Layer**:
   - Encapsulates the business logic and processes of the application.
   - Acts as a bridge between the Web Layer and the DAO Layer.

4. **DAO Layer**:
   - Stands for Data Access Object, responsible for database interactions.
   - Provides methods for CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete).
   - JDBC (Java Database Connectivity) or ORM frameworks like Hibernate are commonly used here.

5. **Database**:
   - The persistent storage layer where the application's data is stored.
   - Hibernate, as mentioned in the diagram, simplifies database interaction by providing an ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) solution.

### Technologies
- **Web Framework**: Struts (Apache Struts Framework).
- **ORM Framework**: Hibernate (for database abstraction).
- **Database**: Any RDBMS (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle DB).

1. **Spring Boot**:
   - The topmost layer in this stack.
   - Provides auto-configuration, built-in dependencies, and embedded server support.
   - Ideal for building microservices or standalone Spring applications.

2. **Spring Framework**:
   - Underlying framework that provides core features such as dependency injection, aspect-oriented programming, and data access abstraction.
   - Used for building enterprise-level applications.

3. **JSE & JEE**:
   - Refers to Java Standard Edition (JSE) and Java Enterprise Edition (JEE).
   - JSE provides core Java functionalities, while JEE offers APIs for web services, persistence, and distributed computing.

4. **Project**:
   - Represents the application being developed, leveraging Spring Boot to streamline development.

### Key Benefits
- **Spring Boot**:
  - Reduces boilerplate code.
  - Enables quick setup and development.
  - Suitable for microservices architecture.

- **Spring Framework**:
  - Offers flexibility and modularization.
